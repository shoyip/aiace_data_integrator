    <h2 id="questions-the-maps-help-answer1">Questions the maps help answer</h2><br>
    <ul class="_90f8">
        <li>How much is a crisis event disrupting movement or commuting levels?</li>
        <li>Where are populations going after they evacuate due to a disaster?</li>
        <li>Where should services be positioned in the aftermath of a disaster?</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h2 id="what-you-can-do-with-these-maps2">What you can do with these maps</h2><br>
    <ul class="_90f8">
        <li>Identify both origin and destination regions with abnormal amounts of population movement.</li>
        <li>Identify areas heavily impacted by disaster.</li>
        <li>Understand dynamics over time and estimate how many people are impacted.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h2 id="who-this-dataset-counts3">Who this dataset counts</h2>
    <p>These maps show how many Facebook app users (who have opted to share their location history data) have moved
        from
        administrative region A to administrative region B between 8-hour time windows while preserving the users’
        privacy. By aggregating location history data, we are able to show a smoothed representation of how many
        people
        have moved from one region to another for each time period.</p>
    <p>Note that this dataset is showing only a subset of the total population in an area, specifically only those
        Facebook app users who have opted in to sharing their device’s location history data with the Facebook app.
        This
        is not the total population moving.</p>
    <p>These counts are also compared to precrisis movement levels between the 2 regions. This can point to areas
        that
        are more impacted by a crisis, describing how evacuations are occurring or how regular movement patterns
        have
        been disrupted.</p><br>
    <h2 id="when-these-maps-are-generated4">When these maps are generated</h2>
    <p>The Facebook app’s Safety Check feature triggers creation of the maps, which cover only the areas affected by
        a
        crisis event. This dataset is generated for each area and time experiencing a crisis. Partners are also
        welcome
        to request dataset generation.</p><br>
    <h2 id="movement-between-administrative-regions-vs.-other-mobility-maps5">Movement Between Administrative
        Regions
        vs. other mobility maps</h2>
    <p>Movement Between Administrative Regions is sometimes called Facebook Movement Maps (Administrative Regions)
        or
        Movement Vectors because it shows the count of people moving from one region to another. A very similar
        dataset
        is called Movement Between Tiles. Several additional datasets describe people’s mobility, including Movement
        Range Maps and Colocation Maps. The naming of this dataset causes some confusion.</p><br>
    <h2 id="understanding-vector-values6">Understanding vector values</h2>
    <p>Vector values are significantly more complex to comprehend and visualize than simple population counts per
        tile
        or per region. A vector has a direction defined by the starting and ending region, and metrics comparing
        crisis
        to baseline can have both positive and negative values. So for example the vector from region A to region B
        can
        be a value of +X, but that does not mean that the vector from region B to region A is -X.</p>
    <p>An easy way to understand the nature of this dataset is to think of commuting. These maps can tell you how
        many
        people went from region A in San Francisco to region B in Menlo Park this morning and whether that is more
        or
        less than a normal day before the crisis. They can also tell you how many people went from region B in Menlo
        Park to region A in San Francisco during the same time period. Of course the magnitude of those counts will
        be
        very different.</p><br>
    <h2 id="calculating-movement-between-administrative-regions7">Calculating movement between administrative
        regions
    </h2>
    <p>The Movement Between Administrative Regions data represents the most common location (in this case
        administrative
        region) of the user within the first time window and then the most common location within the second time
        window. This defines the starting and ending of the vector. The vector time is then assigned to the starting
        time (in UTC) in the second window.</p>
    <p>So for example an individual’s start coordinates for time window A are the administrative region center for
        their
        modal administrative region (the most common region among all their locations in the time period). The end
        coordinates are obtained the same way, but for time window B, which is 8 hours later. The person’s start and
        end
        coordinates are then used to assign them to a vector. Then their start and end coordinates are averaged
        along
        with those of everyone else assigned to that vector to yield the value surfaced in the dataset.</p><br>
    <h2 id="people-who-remain-within-a-single-region8">People who remain within a single region</h2>
    <p>The Movement Between Administrative Regions data also shows Facebook users who remained within a single
        region,
        which is a common point of confusion. Data is provided for the number of users who “moved” from region A to
        region A between 8-hour windows.</p><br>
    <h1 id="data-standards9">Data standards</h1>
    <p><b>Population sample</b>: Movement Between Administrative Regions counts the number of Facebook mobile app
        users
        who have enabled location history sharing.</p>
    <p><b>Minimum spatial aggregation</b>: We surface the Movement Between Administrative Regions counts on the
        smallest
        administrative boundary level that can be completed within its update frequency time of 8 hours, starting
        with
        the minimum level 4. This is equivalent to the boundary of a US neighborhood or district. If we see that our
        calculations will not finish within the 8-hour update window, we move to the next-largest level until we
        find a
        size that will not delay the results. The complexity for this calculation is a function of the overall
        boundary
        rectangle size (which determines the number of subregions inside it) and the number of unique location
        history
        users within the boundary rectangle. This ensures that the version of the datasets available are the most
        granular over space and time allowed by our privacy protections.</p>
    <p>Note: We cannot dynamically alter the level or time window size used for this metric given the complexity of
        our
        calculations.</p>
    <p><b>Temporal aggregation</b>: Movement Between Administrative Regions is aggregated over 2 adjacent 8-hour
        time
        windows. The first (start) 8-hour time segment ends and the second (end) 8-hour window begins at the value
        shown
        in <b>date/time</b>. Dataset generation is triggered by either a Safety Check on the Facebook platform or a
        request to the Data for Good at Meta program. By default the dataset is updated every 8 hours for 14 days,
        but
        additional time can be requested. The dataset is accessible for 90 days after the final update day and then
        is
        discarded.</p>
    <p><b>Minimum counts</b>: If either the <b>baseline </b>or <b>users during crisis</b> time count is less than a
        threshold value of 10 users, then both are dropped.</p>
    <p><b>Crossing international borders</b>: If the <b>starting quadkey</b> and <b>ending quadkey</b> represent
        different countries, then we drop that vector from the dataset as this would indicate crossing an
        international
        border.</p><br>

    <p><b>Baseline (n_baseline): </b>The average number of people:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>The baseline period is the 45 days going back from the day the maps were started (you can see this by looking
        at
        the day the first data is generated). The baseline value is segmented by the day of the week and the time
        window
        for the metric. Thus the baseline value for 00:00 UTC on a Tuesday is the mean value (outliers are
        winsorized,
        not removed) across all the 00:00 UTC plus Tuesdays in the 45 days prior to when the maps first generated.
        This
        means the baseline is a set period of days prior to day zero on the maps, not a rolling window. So for
        example
        each region in the dataset will have 7 days of 3 8-hour windows (00:00 UTC, 08:00 UTC and 16:00 UTC) for a
        total
        of 21 unique baseline values across the dataset. </p>
    <p>If the same person appeared at multiple regions in a time interval, we only count their most frequent region,
        choosing the latest of their most frequent regions in the event of a tie. If this number is below 10, the

        will appear as \N as this is below the level required for privacy protection. </p>

        using only difference between baseline and crisis) or sparse rural areas (which tends to be the case when
        using
        percent change). The calculated z-score is clipped to be a value between -4 and 4. </p>
