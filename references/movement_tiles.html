    <ul class="_90f8">
        <li>How much is movement disrupted by a crisis event?</li>
        <li>Where are populations going after they evacuate due to a disaster?</li>
        <li>Where should services be positioned in the aftermath of a disaster?</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h2 id="what-you-can-do-with-these-maps2">What you can do with these maps</h2><br>
    <ul class="_90f8">
        <li>Identify both origin and destination tiles with abnormal amounts of population movement</li>
        <li>Identify areas heavily impacted by disaster</li>
        <li>Understand dynamics over time and estimate how many people are impacted</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h2 id="who-this-dataset-counts3">Who this dataset counts</h2>
    <p>These maps show how many Facebook app users (who have opted to share their Location History data) have moved from
        tile A to tile B between 8-hour windows while preserving the users’ privacy. By aggregating Location History
        data, we are able to show a smoothed representation of how many Location History users have moved from one tile
        to another for each time period.</p>
    <p>Note that this dataset is showing only a subset of the total population in an area, specifically only those
        Facebook app users who have opted in to sharing their device’s Location History data with the Facebook app. This
        is not the total population moving.</p>
    <p>These counts are also compared to precrisis movement levels between the 2 tiles. This can point to areas that are
        more impacted by a crisis, describing how evacuations are occurring or how regular movement patterns have been
        disrupted.</p><br>
    <h2 id="when-these-maps-are-generated4">When these maps are generated</h2>
    <p>The Facebook app’s Safety Check feature triggers creation of the maps, which cover only the areas affected by a
        crisis event. This dataset is generated for each area and time experiencing a crisis. Partners are also welcome
        to request dataset generation.</p><br>
    <h2 id="movement-between-tiles-vs.-other-mobility-maps5">Movement Between Tiles vs. other mobility maps</h2>
    <p>Movement Between Tiles is sometimes called Facebook Movement Maps (Tile Version) or Movement Vectors because it
        shows the count of people moving from one tile to another. A very similar dataset is called Movement Between
        Administrative Regions. Several additional datasets describe people’s mobility, including Movement Range Maps
        and Colocation Maps. The naming of this dataset causes some confusion.</p><br>
    <h2 id="common-mistakes-to-avoid-with-this-dataset6">Common mistakes to avoid with this dataset</h2>
    <p>When new users see the name Movement Maps, they think this is the dataset they want to use because they are
        interested in human mobility. This is unfortunate because the visualization and interpretation of Facebook
        Population (Tile Version) is a much more beginner-friendly dataset to view.</p>
    <p>The inclination to dive first into movement maps can lead partners to a common mistake. They try to add up all
        the inbound and outbound movement for a single tile in order to calculate a net flux for the tile of interest.
        This is not advised, as any movement vector with fewer than 10 users is excluded to protect privacy. In
        addition, the net flux is actually provided by the Facebook Population (Tile Version) map, as adding up all the
        inbound and outbound movement leaves a single count of total users.</p><br>
    <h2 id="understanding-vector-values7">Understanding vector values</h2>
    <p>Vector values are significantly more complex to comprehend and visualize than simple population counts per tile.
        A vector has a direction defined by the starting and ending tile, and metrics comparing <b>crisis </b>to
        <b>baseline </b>can have both positive and negative values. So for example the vector from tile A to tile B can
        be a value of +X, but that does not mean that the vector from tile B to tile A is -X.</p>
    <p>An easy way to understand the nature of this dataset is to think of commuting. These maps can tell you how many
        people went from tile A in San Francisco to tile B in Menlo Park this morning and whether that is more or fewer
        than a normal day before the crisis. They can also tell you how many people went from tile B in Menlo Park to
        tile A in San Francisco during the same time period. Of course the magnitude of those counts will be very
        different.</p><br>
    <h2 id="calculating-movement-between-tiles8">Calculating movement between tiles</h2>
    <p>The Movement Between Tiles data represents the most common location (Bing tile) of the user within the first time
        window, and then the most common location within the second time window. This defines the starting and ending of
        the vector. The vector time is then assigned to the starting time (in UTC) in the second window.</p>
    <p>So for example an individual’s start coordinates for time window A are the tile center for their modal Bing tile
        (the most common Bing tile among all their locations in the time period). The end coordinates are obtained the
        same way, but for time window B, which is 8 hours later. The user’s start and end coordinates are then used to
        assign them to a vector. Then the user’s start and end coordinates are averaged along with those of everyone
        else assigned to that vector to yield the value surfaced in the dataset.</p><br>
    <h2 id="people-who-remain-within-a-single-tile9">People who remain within a single tile</h2>
    <p>The Movement Between Tiles data also shows people who remained within a single tile, which is a common point of
        confusion. Data is provided for the number of people who “moved” from tile A to tile A between 8-hour windows.
    </p><br>
    <h1 id="data-standards10">Data standards</h1>
    <p><b>Population sample</b>: Movement Between Tiles is derived from Facebook mobile app users who have enabled
        Location History sharing.</p>
    <p><b>Minimum spatial aggregation</b>: We surface the Movement Between Tiles counts on the smallest tile size that
        can be completed within an 8-hour update frequency, starting with the minimum tile size allowed for privacy
        protections, Bing tile level 16. This is equivalent to roughly 600 meters on a side near the equator or the size
        of 2 city blocks. If we see that our calculations will not finish within the 8-hour update window, we move to
        the next-largest Bing tile until we find a size that will not delay the results. The complexity for this
        calculation is a function of the overall boundary rectangle size (which determines the number of tiles inside
        it) and the number of unique Location History users within the boundary rectangle. This ensures that the version
        of the datasets available is the most granular over space and time allowed by our privacy protections.</p>
    <p>Note: We cannot dynamically alter the tile size or time window for this metric given the complexity of our
        calculations.</p>
    <p>Because Movement Between Tiles is a cross product of all tiles, the computation for it is much more complex than
        the Facebook Population (Tile Level) dataset, so these datasets will often be surfaced at different tile sizes.
    </p>
    <p><b>Temporal aggregation</b>: Movement Between Tiles is aggregated over 2 adjacent 8-hour time windows. The first
        (start) 8-hour time segment ends and the second (end) 8-hour window begins at the value shown in
        <b>date/time</b>.</p>
    <p><b>Update frequency and dataset start date</b>: Dataset generation is triggered by either a Safety Check on the
        Facebook platform or a request to the Data for Good at Meta program. By default the dataset is updated every 8
        hours for 14 days, but additional time can be requested. The dataset is accessible for 90 days after the final
        update day and then is discarded.</p>
    <p><b>Minimum counts</b>: If either the <b>baseline </b>or <b>users during crisis</b> time count is less than a
        threshold value of 10 users, then both are dropped.</p>
    <p><b>Crossing international borders</b>: If the <b>starting quadkey</b> and <b>ending quadkey</b> represent
        different countries, then we drop that vector from the dataset as this would indicate crossing an international
        border.</p><br>

    <p>The baseline period is the 45 days going back from the day the maps were started (you can see this by looking at
        the day the first data is generated). The baseline value is segmented by the day of the week and the time window
        for the metric. Thus the baseline value for 00:00 UTC on a Tuesday is the mean value (outliers are winsorized,
        not removed) across all the 00:00 UTC plus Tuesdays in the 45 days prior to when the maps first generated. This
        means the baseline is a set period of days prior to day zero on the maps, not a rolling window. So for example
        each region in the dataset will have 7 days of 3 8-hour windows (00:00 UTC, 08:00 UTC and 16:00 UTC) for a total
        of 21 unique baseline values across the dataset. </p>

        above or below the <b>baseline (n_baseline)</b></p>
    <p>The z-score (sometimes called the standard score) highlights the areas with the most significant differences
        between what is observed during the crisis and what is typically seen during the baseline. Our recommended
        metric, it prevents the measured change from being dominated by dense areas (which tends to be the case when
        using only difference between baseline and crisis) or sparse rural areas (which tends to be the case when using
        percent change). The calculated z-score is clipped to be a value between -4 and 4. </p>

        identifies a single tile at a particular level of detail. Quadkeys provide a one-dimensional index key that
        usually preserves the proximity of tiles in latitudinal and longitudinal space. In other words, 2 tiles that

        Counting the number of characters in a quadkey string is a quick way to determine the tile’s spatial
        granularity.<br>Note: Leading zeros are important and must be preserved in order to properly identify the tile.
        Although the values appear numeric, we recommend converting them into a string. Common spreadsheet tools like
        Excel and Google Sheets will not do this by default.</p>
